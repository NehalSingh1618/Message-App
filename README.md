## Technology Stack

Our platform is built using a modern technology stack to provide a robust and efficient user experience:

ReactJS: The core framework for building responsive and interactive user interfaces.
Bootstrap: A responsive design framework for a consistent and appealing UI.
Jitsi Meet: Our chosen video conferencing solution, known for easy integration and scalability.
ChatEngine: Facilitating real-time chat functionality within the application.
Firebase: Used for authentication, storage, and managing user data.

## Development Approach

Our development process adheres to agile methodology, emphasizing collaboration and flexibility throughout the project's lifecycle:

Project Design: The project began with a comprehensive design phase, during which we identified key features and explored available technology options.
Prototyping: We created early prototypes using various technologies, such as OpenVidu, WebRTC, and Jitsi Meet. After thorough evaluation, we selected Jitsi Meet for its ease of integration and ability to handle a large number of participants with minimal browser load.
Feature Expansion: We expanded the Jitsi Meet prototype to include additional features. ChatEngine was integrated for real-time communication, Firebase was employed for user authentication and data storage, and the user interface was enhanced. The innovative "Polls" feature was introduced for interactive participation.
Enhancing Communication: We integrated the chat feature into the video call component, transitioning from Jitsi Meet's chat to a more versatile group chat. Additionally, we introduced "Meeting Notes," enabling participants to collaboratively create and edit notes using a rich text editor during meetings.

This unique blend of features and technologies ensures an engaging and productive video conferencing experience for our users.
